# Dice Challenge Project

## Overview

This project explores various aspects of dice combinations, probabilities, and transformations. It provides functionalities to calculate the total combinations, display the distribution of possible combinations, and calculate probabilities for both original and modified dice scenarios.

## Features

- **Total Combinations:** Calculates the total number of combinations when rolling two dice.
- **All Possible Combinations:** Generates and displays a 6x6 matrix of all possible combinations for two six-sided dice.
- **Dice Probabilities:** Calculates the probabilities of obtaining each possible sum when rolling two dice.
- **Dice Transformation:** Applies a transformation to dice values and recalculates probabilities.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vlokesh08/Securein-The-Doomed-Dice-Challenge.git
